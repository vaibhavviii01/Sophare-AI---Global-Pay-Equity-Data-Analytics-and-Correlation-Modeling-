# Sophare AI - Global Pay Equity Data Analytics and Correlation Modeling 

**Data-Driven Benchmarking & Financial Correlation Analysis**
As the lead for data analysis and quality on this capstone project, I developed a production-ready intelligence platform that standardizes gender pay gap (GPG) reporting across the United Kingdom, Ireland, and France. My work focused on transforming heterogeneous regulatory disclosures into a unified analytical framework to help investors and policymakers identify genuine equity leaders.

**🚀 Key Insights & Impact**
During this project, I moved beyond simple data processing to uncover the structural drivers of pay inequality:

**The "Bonus Gap" Signal:** I identified that bonus gaps remain significantly larger than hourly pay gaps (averaging 15–21% in the UK). My analysis showed that while hourly gaps are narrowing, bonus inequality is actually widening in markets like Ireland.

**Representation as a Predictor:** Through correlation analysis, I proved that female representation in top-quartile roles is the single strongest predictor of a lower overall pay gap.

**Market Realities (The Null Finding):** I conducted a rigorous study of 183 NYSE-listed companies and found no systematic evidence that pay equity currently predicts stock performance. I positioned this "null finding" as a strategic asset for Sophare AI, establishing their credibility as an evidence-based partner that values scientific integrity over marketing narratives.
